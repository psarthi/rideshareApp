For converting from Backend Models to Android - Following things has to be taken care

1. Convert ZonedDateTime to Date
2. Convert LocalTime to String
3. Convery @jsonproperty to @SerializedName
4. Remove any jackson specific annotation e.g. jsonignoreproperties (Gson will ignore extra unknown fields automatically)
5. Remove @JsonIgnore from setter level e.g. in Point
6. Change the package name of GoogleDirection and GoogleDistance to the android specific package
6. Remove MultiPolygon object e.g. in RideRequestSearchResult
